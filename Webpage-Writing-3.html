        <p>
            Welcome to this page, and you are here because you want to help your environment,<br>
            or you are here to learn about our environment. I am here to spread my knowledge<br>
            about air pollution, and what you should do to prevent it. I chose to do this because<br>
            I believe that many people think they know what is going in our environment, but they<br>
            really don’t. So that’s why, I am writing this article so that you know what it is,<br>
            and how to deal with problems in our environment. In addition, I am spreading my thoughts<br>
            to you people, so that you know.<br>
